# bru-sec
## Under Construction

A cross-platform desktop shell that is meant to temporarily replace your bash terminal (regardless of your OS: in Linux/MacOS/Win all compatible) to help the user run powerful scans on their network, along with several different tools that fall in the Network Security. It is designed to look great; using colors and some simple animations. 
With brusec, you have an extra security filter that your standard terminal does not provide. This is the perfect shell for those learning to use a terminal in their workflow OR for the veteran coder who would like some extra functionality and automation capabilities. 
Some features that make the shell great are: 

* Compatible for any OS (Win/Linux/Mac) desktop.
* Access to many different built-in scans, with automation and network tools.
* Integrated SSH client with a connection manager.
* File transfer from/to SSH sessions via SFTP and Zmodem
